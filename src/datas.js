    content: `What happened?
I helped a man move to the UK. His name was Tobi, and I met him during my first year at the university before I moved to the UK. We were coursemates, and we grew close. After I moved, we kept in touch. He was one of the few friends I didn’t lose touch with.

In 2020, Tobi decided to move to the UK. I helped him with the process because we were close. However, the first time he applied, he made a rookie mistake of using a microfinance bank for his proof of funds, and the visa was denied.

He tried again in 2021/2022, and I helped him with everything from school admission to visa processing. We grew even closer and started spending longer hours talking on the phone. Tobi suddenly started calling me “babe.” Then, one day, he said, “I love you.”

I didn’t take him seriously at first because we were friends and hadn’t known each other on that level. He eventually moved to the UK and asked me to be his girlfriend. I said yes. That’s when everything started falling apart. 

How so?
At first, I struggled to respect the relationship. I still saw Tobi as a friend and didn’t treat him the way one would treat a partner. I spoke to him like a sibling and didn’t filter my words. He was older than me, so it didn’t sit well with him. It naturally led to arguments between us. 

Another big issue was his smoking. He never smoked around his parents, so I couldn’t understand why he’d smoke around me, even after I had made it clear that I didn’t like it. I consistently talked about the smoking thing, and eventually, he started pulling away. 

We had a big fight one day, and when I called to apologise, I couldn’t reach him all day. I hate malice, so I texted him saying, “If you don’t reach out by this time, we’re done.” He didn’t, so I ended the relationship.

My friends told me I overreacted, but I stood by my decision. We broke up for about two weeks. Eventually, I reached out to Tobi, apologised, and we got back together. But things didn’t really go back to normal. I think I’d done too much damage.

What damage did you do?
I hooked up with someone else three times during the two weeks we broke up. I didn’t think much of it then because we were over. I was sad, the guy was there, and it happened. I didn’t even feel bad at the time because we weren’t together.

After we got back together, I archived the chat with the other guy. But Tobi searched my phone, found the archived chat, and got suspicious. The messages weren’t even flirty, just basic stuff like “Are you upstairs?” because we worked together. Still, he figured everything out. 

That night, he confronted me. I denied it at first, but he later called me and said, “Tell me the truth. I saw the chat.” So I admitted that I hooked up with the other guy during that breakup. He didn’t take it well at all.

He started asking for unnecessary details like, “How many times? What position?” I didn’t answer because I didn’t know how those answers would have helped him heal. But he wanted to know everything, and when I explained that we weren’t together then, he got even angrier. He started seeing me as “loose,” which hurt because anyone who knows me knows that’s not who I am. But I was vulnerable and hurting, and the guy was there. 

Did you still want to work things out with him after that?
Yes. I apologised and told him I still wanted us to make it work. I admitted I was wrong, but I didn’t cheat. We were broken up. I was the one who even reached out to reconcile, so clearly, I was serious. He forgave me, but just shortly after, we found ourselves in another mess. 

Before all this, we had planned to pay his school fees for the second year. He needed to pay about £13,000. I got him a job in my town where he’d be paid £500 monthly. I even gave him the first £5,000 from my savings. Then I sourced an additional £5,000 through work connections. Out of that full £13k, I helped him raise £10k, which he was supposed to pay me back at some point. At that point, I was still dealing with the guilt of hurting him and just wanted to make our relationship work. I thought helping him would also soften the blow of everything that had happened. I was wrong.

It didn’t?
Not even close. After helping him raise his school fees, things got worse. He’d throw jabs, bring up the past out of nowhere and shame me for something I’d already apologised for. One minute we’re talking normally, the next he’s saying things like, “What kind of girl are you? You go to church and do these things?” And it would always go back to me hooking up with someone else.

I never denied it happened. I explained that during our break, I was heartbroken, and the person was there. But he never let it go. I still tried. I didn’t want to be the person who walked away again, so I fought for us. But it started feeling like I was fighting alone. He called me a gaslighter. He made me feel like I was the worst person alive.

I’m sorry about that
I never judged Tobi for being who he was. In fact, I wanted to be more open-minded, so we could grow stronger. Remember his smoking habit? I tried meeting him halfway.  I baked edibles for our first anniversary getaway. We went to an amusement park in London. I only ate one, but I don’t smoke or take weed, so that one edible completely messed me up.

I was dazed, couldn’t see properly. On one of the rides, the edibles kicked in. Everything spiralled and I ended up throwing up in a restaurant. I could barely function. Instead of helping me, he got irritated. On the train home, I had a scarf and a long skirt on, but he claimed I was “intentionally” opening my legs to show people my thighs. 

I was not even aware of what was going on. But rather than helping me or covering me, he sat far away and used it later to shame me. That moment, I mentally checked out of the relationship.

Later that evening, he wanted to get intimate, but the bed was squeaky, and I wasn’t in the right headspace. After I said no, he went to masturbate in the bathroom, knowing fully well that I could hear him. That was the last straw. I just cried the whole way home. I didn’t recognise the person he’d become. He wasn’t the friend I once had.

That’s horrible. I’m so sorry
That’s not the worst of it.  Tobi betrayed me again in the worst way. Before we officially broke up, I got into a fight with my sister. It got physical. I was vulnerable and told him about it, thinking he’d comfort me.

He called my sister behind my back to “fact-check” my side of the story. I don’t know what led to that, but he also told her everything about our relationship—things I had only ever confided in him. He painted me as a manipulative, toxic person and convinced my own sister that I was the villain.

For a whole month, my sister didn’t speak to me. Meanwhile, he called her every day, feeding her all the worst bits of our relationship. The betrayal of that broke me. From that point on, I stopped telling my family anything about my personal life.

He also spoke to our mutual friends in parables, using them to shame me and stir drama indirectly. All of this was happening before the official breakup. He had already started painting me as “the crazy ex” even though we weren’t broken up yet.

At some point, I just couldn’t understand what was happening anymore. He kept saying, “People think you’re so perfect.” Eventually, we called it quits. `,

After I said no, he went to masturbate in the bathroom, knowing fully well that I could hear him. That was the last straw. I just cried the whole way home. I didn’t recognise the person he’d become. He wasn’t the friend I once had.

That’s horrible. I’m so sorry
That’s not the worst of it.  Tobi betrayed me again in the worst way. Before we officially broke up, I got into a fight with my sister. It got physical. I was vulnerable and told him about it, thinking he’d comfort me.

He called my sister behind my back to “fact-check” my side of the story. I don’t know what led to that, but he also told her everything about our relationship—things I had only ever confided in him. He painted me as a manipulative, toxic person and convinced my own sister that I was the villain.

For a whole month, my sister didn’t speak to me. Meanwhile, he called her every day, feeding her all the worst bits of our relationship. The betrayal of that broke me. From that point on, I stopped telling my family anything about my personal life.

He also spoke to our mutual friends in parables, using them to shame me and stir drama indirectly. All of this was happening before the official breakup. He had already started painting me as “the crazy ex” even though we weren’t broken up yet.

At some point, I just couldn’t understand what was happening anymore. He kept saying, “People think you’re so perfect.” Eventually, we called it quits. `,

      "I Caught My Ex With Someone Else Right After He Begged Me to Take Him Back",
    creator: "Adey6inka Oduntayo",
    date: "July 21, 2025",
    content: `What happened?
I helped a man move to the UK. His name was Tobi, and I met him during my first year at the university before I moved to the UK. We were coursemates, and we grew close. After I moved, we kept in touch. He was one of the few friends I didn’t lose touch with.

In 2020, Tobi decided to move to the UK. I helped him with the process because we were close. However, the first time he applied, he made a rookie mistake of using a microfinance bank for his proof of funds, and the visa was denied.

He tried again in 2021/2022, and I helped him with everything from school admission to visa processing. We grew even closer and started spending longer hours talking on the phone. Tobi suddenly started calling me “babe.” Then, one day, he said, “I love you.”

I didn’t take him seriously at first because we were friends and hadn’t known each other on that level. He eventually moved to the UK and asked me to be his girlfriend. I said yes. That’s when everything started falling apart. 

How so?
At first, I struggled to respect the relationship. I still saw Tobi as a friend and didn’t treat him the way one would treat a partner. I spoke to him like a sibling and didn’t filter my words. He was older than me, so it didn’t sit well with him. It naturally led to arguments between us. 

Another big issue was his smoking. He never smoked around his parents, so I couldn’t understand why he’d smoke around me, even after I had made it clear that I didn’t like it. I consistently talked about the smoking thing, and eventually, he started pulling away. 

We had a big fight one day, and when I called to apologise, I couldn’t reach him all day. I hate malice, so I texted him saying, “If you don’t reach out by this time, we’re done.” He didn’t, so I ended the relationship.

My friends told me I overreacted, but I stood by my decision. We broke up for about two weeks. Eventually, I reached out to Tobi, apologised, and we got back together. But things didn’t really go back to normal. I think I’d done too much damage.

What damage did you do?
I hooked up with someone else three times during the two weeks we broke up. I didn’t think much of it then because we were over. I was sad, the guy was there, and it happened. I didn’t even feel bad at the time because we weren’t together.

After we got back together, I archived the chat with the other guy. But Tobi searched my phone, found the archived chat, and got suspicious. The messages weren’t even flirty, just basic stuff like “Are you upstairs?” because we worked together. Still, he figured everything out. 

That night, he confronted me. I denied it at first, but he later called me and said, “Tell me the truth. I saw the chat.” So I admitted that I hooked up with the other guy during that breakup. He didn’t take it well at all.

He started asking for unnecessary details like, “How many times? What position?” I didn’t answer because I didn’t know how those answers would have helped him heal. But he wanted to know everything, and when I explained that we weren’t together then, he got even angrier. He started seeing me as “loose,” which hurt because anyone who knows me knows that’s not who I am. But I was vulnerable and hurting, and the guy was there. 

Did you still want to work things out with him after that?
Yes. I apologised and told him I still wanted us to make it work. I admitted I was wrong, but I didn’t cheat. We were broken up. I was the one who even reached out to reconcile, so clearly, I was serious. He forgave me, but just shortly after, we found ourselves in another mess. 

Before all this, we had planned to pay his school fees for the second year. He needed to pay about £13,000. I got him a job in my town where he’d be paid £500 monthly. I even gave him the first £5,000 from my savings. Then I sourced an additional £5,000 through work connections. Out of that full £13k, I helped him raise £10k, which he was supposed to pay me back at some point. At that point, I was still dealing with the guilt of hurting him and just wanted to make our relationship work. I thought helping him would also soften the blow of everything that had happened. I was wrong.

It didn’t?
Not even close. After helping him raise his school fees, things got worse. He’d throw jabs, bring up the past out of nowhere and shame me for something I’d already apologised for. One minute we’re talking normally, the next he’s saying things like, “What kind of girl are you? You go to church and do these things?” And it would always go back to me hooking up with someone else.

I never denied it happened. I explained that during our break, I was heartbroken, and the person was there. But he never let it go. I still tried. I didn’t want to be the person who walked away again, so I fought for us. But it started feeling like I was fighting alone. He called me a gaslighter. He made me feel like I was the worst person alive.

I’m sorry about that
I never judged Tobi for being who he was. In fact, I wanted to be more open-minded, so we could grow stronger. Remember his smoking habit? I tried meeting him halfway.  I baked edibles for our first anniversary getaway. We went to an amusement park in London. I only ate one, but I don’t smoke or take weed, so that one edible completely messed me up.

I was dazed, couldn’t see properly. On one of the rides, the edibles kicked in. Everything spiralled and I ended up throwing up in a restaurant. I could barely function. Instead of helping me, he got irritated. On the train home, I had a scarf and a long skirt on, but he claimed I was “intentionally” opening my legs to show people my thighs. 

I was not even aware of what was going on. But rather than helping me or covering me, he sat far away and used it later to shame me. That moment, I mentally checked out of the relationship.

Later that evening, he wanted to get intimate, but the bed was squeaky, and I wasn’t in the right headspace.

For a whole month, my sister didn’t speak to me. Meanwhile, he called her every day, feeding her all the worst bits of our relationship. The betrayal of that broke me. From that point on, I stopped telling my family anything about my personal life.

He also spoke to our mutual friends in parables, using them to shame me and stir drama indirectly. All of this was happening before the official breakup. He had already started painting me as “the crazy ex” even though we weren’t broken up yet.

At some point, I just couldn’t understand what was happening anymore. He kept saying, “People think you’re so perfect.” Eventually, we called it quits. `,

    content: `What happened?
I helped a man move to the UK. His name was Tobi, and I met him during my first year at the university before I moved to the UK. We were coursemates, and we grew close. After I moved, we kept in touch. He was one of the few friends I didn’t lose touch with.

In 2020, Tobi decided to move to the UK. I helped him with the process because we were close. However, the first time he applied, he made a rookie mistake of using a microfinance bank for his proof of funds, and the visa was denied.

He tried again in 2021/2022, and I helped him with everything from school admission to visa processing. We grew even closer and started spending longer hours talking on the phone. Tobi suddenly started calling me “babe.” Then, one day, he said, “I love you.”

I didn’t take him seriously at first because we were friends and hadn’t known each other on that level. He eventually moved to the UK and asked me to be his girlfriend. I said yes. That’s when everything started falling apart. 

How so?
At first, I struggled to respect the relationship. I still saw Tobi as a friend and didn’t treat him the way one would treat a partner. I spoke to him like a sibling and didn’t filter my words. He was older than me, so it didn’t sit well with him. It naturally led to arguments between us. 

Another big issue was his smoking. He never smoked around his parents, so I couldn’t understand why he’d smoke around me, even after I had made it clear that I didn’t like it. I consistently talked about the smoking thing, and eventually, he started pulling away. 

We had a big fight one day, and when I called to apologise, I couldn’t reach him all day. I hate malice, so I texted him saying, “If you don’t reach out by this time, we’re done.” He didn’t, so I ended the relationship.

My friends told me I overreacted, but I stood by my decision. We broke up for about two weeks. Eventually, I reached out to Tobi, apologised, and we got back together. But things didn’t really go back to normal. I think I’d done too much damage.

What damage did you do?
I hooked up with someone else three times during the two weeks we broke up. I didn’t think much of it then because we were over. I was sad, the guy was there, and it happened. I didn’t even feel bad at the time because we weren’t together.

After we got back together, I archived the chat with the other guy. But Tobi searched my phone, found the archived chat, and got suspicious. The messages weren’t even flirty, just basic stuff like “Are you upstairs?” because we worked together. Still, he figured everything out. 

That night, he confronted me. I denied it at first, but he later called me and said, “Tell me the truth. I saw the chat.” So I admitted that I hooked up with the other guy during that breakup. He didn’t take it well at all.

He started asking for unnecessary details like, “How many times? What position?” I didn’t answer because I didn’t know how those answers would have helped him heal. But he wanted to know everything, and when I explained that we weren’t together then, he got even angrier. He started seeing me as “loose,” which hurt because anyone who knows me knows that’s not who I am. But I was vulnerable and hurting, and the guy was there. 

Did you still want to work things out with him after that?
Yes. I apologised and told him I still wanted us to make it work. I admitted I was wrong, but I didn’t cheat. We were broken up. I was the one who even reached out to reconcile, so clearly, I was serious. He forgave me, but just shortly after, we found ourselves in another mess. 

Before all this, we had planned to pay his school fees for the second year. He needed to pay about £13,000. I got him a job in my town where he’d be paid £500 monthly. I even gave him the first £5,000 from my savings. Then I sourced an additional £5,000 through work connections. Out of that full £13k, I helped him raise £10k, which he was supposed to pay me back at some point. At that point, I was still dealing with the guilt of hurting him and just wanted to make our relationship work. I thought helping him would also soften the blow of everything that had happened. I was wrong.

It didn’t?
Not even close. After helping him raise his school fees, things got worse. He’d throw jabs, bring up the past out of nowhere and shame me for something I’d already apologised for. One minute we’re talking normally, the next he’s saying things like, “What kind of girl are you? You go to church and do these things?” And it would always go back to me hooking up with someone else.

I never denied it happened. I explained that during our break, I was heartbroken, and the person was there. But he never let it go. I still tried. I didn’t want to be the person who walked away again, so I fought for us. But it started feeling like I was fighting alone. He called me a gaslighter. He made me feel like I was the worst person alive.

I’m sorry about that
I never judged Tobi for being who he was. In fact, I wanted to be more open-minded, so we could grow stronger. Remember his smoking habit? I tried meeting him halfway.  I baked edibles for our first anniversary getaway. We went to an amusement park in London. I only ate one, but I don’t smoke or take weed, so that one edible completely messed me up.

I was dazed, couldn’t see properly. On one of the rides, the edibles kicked in. Everything spiralled and I ended up throwing up in a restaurant. I could barely function. Instead of helping me, he got irritated. On the train home, I had a scarf and a long skirt on, but he claimed I was “intentionally” opening my legs to show people my thighs. 

I was not even aware of what was going on. But rather than helping me or covering me, he sat far away and used it later to shame me. That moment, I mentally checked out of the relationship.

Later that evening, he wanted to get intimate, but the bed was squeaky, and I wasn’t in the right headspace. After I said no, he went to masturbate in the bathroom, knowing fully well that I could hear him. That was the last straw. I just cried the whole way home. I didn’t recognise the person he’d become. He wasn’t the friend I once had.

That’s horrible. I’m so sorry
That’s not the worst of it.  Tobi betrayed me again in the worst way. Before we officially broke up, I got into a fight with my sister. It got physical. I was vulnerable and told him about it, thinking he’d comfort me.

He called my sister behind my back to “fact-check” my side of the story. I don’t know what led to that, but he also told her everything about our relationship—things I had only ever confided in him. He painted me as a manipulative, toxic person and convinced my own sister that I was the villain.
